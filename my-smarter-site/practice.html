    <h1>Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>
    <h2>The sun is strong and the people are weird.</h2>
    <p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>
